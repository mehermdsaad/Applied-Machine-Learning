# Avazu Click-Through Rate Prediction

This project focuses on predicting the click-through rate (CTR) for mobile ad placements. The goal is to build a model that can accurately predict whether a user will click on an ad based on a given set of features.

## Project Overview

The core of this project is a machine learning model that has been trained on the Avazu dataset to perform click-through rate prediction. The model analyzes various anonymized features related to user, device, and ad attributes to make its predictions.

## Dataset

The model is trained on the Avazu dataset, which contains 10 days of ad click-through data. 
## How to Run

The entire workflow, from data preprocessing to model training and evaluation, is contained within the `ClickPredictionAVAZU.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook. To run the project, you can open the notebook and execute the cells sequentially.
