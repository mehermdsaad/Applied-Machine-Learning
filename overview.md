# Repository Overview

This repository contains three main projects:

**1. GAN_AnimeGen:**
*   **Description:** This project uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate new anime character images. It's built with a Deep Convolutional GAN (DCGAN) architecture, which consists of a generator and a discriminator.
*   **How to run:** The project includes a Jupyter Notebook, `AnimeGen.ipynb`, that you can use to train the model and generate images.

**2. RL_CartPoleBalance:**
*   **Description:** This project focuses on training a Reinforcement Learning agent to solve the CartPole balancing problem. It implements and explores three different RL agents: REINFORCE, REINFORCE with Baseline, and Actor-Critic.
*   **Project Structure:** The project is well-organized, with separate directories for the source code, documents, and saved models. It also includes a series of Python scripts for testing the environment, models, and training the different RL agents.

**3. ML_ClickPrediction:**
*   **Description:** This project focuses on predicting the click-through rate (CTR) for mobile ad placements using the Avazu dataset.
*   **How to run:** The entire workflow is contained within the `ClickPredictionAVAZU.ipynb` Jupyter Notebook.
