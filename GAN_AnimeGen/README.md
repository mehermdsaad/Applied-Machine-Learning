# GAN-based Anime Character Generation

This project uses a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) to generate new anime character images.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to train a GAN model on a dataset of anime character images. The trained model can then be used to generate new, original anime characters that are not present in the dataset.

## Dataset

The model is trained on a dataset of anime character images.

## Model Architecture

The project uses a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN). The architecture consists of two main parts:

- **Generator:** Takes a random noise vector as input and generates an image.
- **Discriminator:** Takes an image as input and determines whether it is a real image from the dataset or a fake image generated by the generator.

The generator and discriminator are trained together in an adversarial manner. The generator tries to create images that can fool the discriminator, while the discriminator tries to get better at distinguishing real images from fake ones.

## How to Run

``

1.  **Train the model:**
    Open the `AnimeGen.ipynb` notebook and run the cells to train the model.
2.  **Generate images:**
    Once the model is trained, you can use it to generate new images by running the appropriate cells in the notebook.

## Results

The generated images will resemble anime characters. The quality of the generated images depends on the size of the dataset, the model architecture, and the training time.
